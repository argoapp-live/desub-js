```

  

## Getting Started

  
A simple guide for using the desub package to interacts with your contract. The smart contract can be found [here](https://github.com/spheronFdn/subscriptions-contract). If you make any significant change to the contracts, then you'll have to make some some changes to the package and  copy the ABIs to the constants/subscription.ts file. Contracts can be deployed on any EVM chain with support for solidity. If you are adopting the spheron contract without significant change, you can proceed to follow this quick guide.
## Installation
Using NPM
```
npm install @spheron/desub-js
```

Using Yarn
```
yarn add @spheron/desub-js
```
## Usage
```js
import * as paymentSmartContract from "@spheron/desub-js";
import { Wallet } from  "@ethersproject/wallet";

async function getUserContractBalance(subContractData: { paymentContractAddress: string, dataContractAddress: string }, tokenAddress: string, tokenPrecision: number, walletAddress: string) {
    const httpProvider = "<insert provider URL>"
    const  signer  =  Wallet.fromMnemonic("<Inser wallet mnemonic>").connect(httpProvider);
    
    const vendor = new paymentSmartContract.Vendor(httpProvider, signer);
    const subscription = new paymentSmartContract.Subscription(vendor);
    
    await subscription.subscriptionAt(
        paymentContractAddress,
        dataContractAddress,
        tokenAddress,
        tokenPrecision
    );
    
    const availableBalance = await subscription.getUserTokenBalance(walletAddress);
    return availableBalance;
}

```
